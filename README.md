# logarithmic functions

logarithmic functions are the *inverse* functions of exponential functions

the logarthmic function ``y = log2(x)`` is the inverse function of the exponential function ``y = 2^(x)``

the logarthmic function interchanges the `x` and the `y` of the exponential function

in the exponential function ``y = 2^(x)`` the output `y` is the value resulting from `2^(x)` or "2 to the power of x"

in the logarithmic function ``y = log2(x)`` the output `y` is the value that yields `x` when raised as the exponent of 2 or `2^(y)`
